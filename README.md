# About the Project

This project was completed as part of the assignment provided by [PureSoft Labs OÃœ]. The Assignment was to develop a responsive restaurant table booking system using Next.js with Typescript for the frontend and Node.js with Express for backend functionality.

**Project link ðŸ‘‰** : https://slotbooking-assignment-frontend.vercel.app/ 

## The app needed to include the following core features:

- **Booking Form** : Users could input Date and time for the reservation, Number of guests, contact details and Validation was required for all fields to ensure proper data entry.
- **Availability Display** : Display available time slots based on the selected date and time and Prevent double bookings by validating against backend data.
- **Booking Summary** : Display a confirmation message or page after successful booking and Include a summary of the reservation details.
- **Ground Rule** : The app had to be mobile-responsive and fully functional. A live deployment link was provided for both frontend and backend.

## Features

- **Modern Design** : Built with Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive design.
- **Dynamic Routing** : Powered by Next.js, providing seamless client- and server-side rendering.
- **Secure APIs** : The backend, built with Node.js and Express, ensures secure and reliable handling of booking data.
- **TypeScript Support** : Ensures type safety and better developer experience.
- **Real-Time Calendar Integration** : Implemented using React Day Picker and date-fns, allowing users to visually select dates and times for reservations.
- **Form Validation** : Utilizes Zod for robust and schema-based form validation, ensuring accurate and secure data entry.
- **Responsive Design** : Fully optimized for both desktop and mobile platforms, ensuring a consistent and seamless experience across devices, including support for minimum 320px mobile screens.

## Developer note :
Due to time constraints, there were some features I couldn't implement, but they will be rolled out in the next updates.
- **O-Auth / supabse based authentication** : Currently, there are no flows for login or signup. However, to speed up the process and improve the user experience, authentication will be enhanced in the next update.
- **state management** : Currently, the states are not persistent across different tabs or sessions. This will be addressed in the next update.
- **Improved Ui and Ux** : While I am not the best at design, as you can see, I plan to improve the design and reduce navigation and data loading times in the next update.
- *ðŸ‘‰ Time for a short break from this project! Looking forward to my next one, and Iâ€™ll be back with the new updates. See you next time! ðŸ˜„.*
